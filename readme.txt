In this project, you will use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether 
there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history 
and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a 
correlation between the two.


Draw conclusions from your analysis and use visuals to answer the following questions:

Analysis Questions:

    What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income?
    What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate?
    What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer sales and customer incomes?
    Which customer do you predict has the highest income?
    Which product will be advertised the most?

Present your analysis

You’ll need to present your analysis as a 1 page written summary and visual report in Power BI. Use the following visuals to present your data:

    Income Distribution: Histogram
    Household Income by Location: Map
    Correlations: Scatter Plot with Trendline and Card with R^2 value
